Hi! This is a simple game I'm working on.

I think that I want to grow it into something big, but I'm keeping it small for now.
So basically, this game is a Pong Roguelike, meaning that you play a game a pong to receive points, purchase upgrades, and continue the game loop :)
However, I was thinking later on, I add like other stuff, like every time, there's random stuff on screen, like coins and mines to take away a life.
Please always suggest ideas!
